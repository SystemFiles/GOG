# GOG - Opinionated Git

GOG is an Opinionated Git workflow CLI tool written in Golang to help developers enforce consistency and strong project/version management within their projects without the added complexity of manual process documentation. Rather GOG allows you to focus on developing features and bringing value to stakeholders rather than managing versions, dependencies and CHANGELOGs.
